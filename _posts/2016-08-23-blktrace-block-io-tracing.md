In this post, I'll explain how to use blktrace to trace block input output operations. You will need to install `blktrace` utility on your machine.
blktrace uses data saved by debugfs, so you'll need to enable it. Please refer my [post](http://chetnachaudhari.github.io/2016-05-08/how-to-enable-debugfs/) for more details.
